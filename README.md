Abstract

Now-a-days, recommender systems are used by a wide variety of users. It aims to provide a trusted review about different businesses. In this project we have used a trust system that evaluates the trust based on the author’s interaction and relationship with other authors. This system collects and maintains data about different authors, their reviews and hotel details and estimates a relation between them.  It determines trust based on the ratings given of users given to each other. This relationship is given in terms of reviews and ratings on their reviews. The author’s reputation (trust) is computed based on its opinion, rating scores and review influence. <br>
