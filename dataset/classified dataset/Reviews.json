The motel was walking distance to the space needle and the mono-rail. The whole foods market was close by with any food. We loved it.

For the price, of around 30 something a night, it was better than expected. Location isn't too bad. It's across from the light rail but it wasn't too loud. Area not too bad, but you need to use common sense about walking around the area at night. The hotel is older but in decent shape for its age. Only complaint about the room is that the window only has a sheer curtain so you cannot block out the light at all; only other problem was thin walls. It sounded like some guy was urinating in my bathroom, the sound traveled so well--kinda strange. The room was pretty big with a king size bed, large desk, sofa, coffee table, and easy chair--practically a suite.

All downtown hotels were way expensive, I found the Lexington and it was near the light rail to take downtown, and was considerably cheaper. Reviews on one travel site were not bad, and having lived in Phoenix a good part of my life, I knew the area and decided to stay here. Well, the staff was nice, the room was large...that's where it ends. The room was large, but I would not have sat in the overstuffed armchair in that room for anything. The carpet was badly stained, beds felt like you were sleeping on box springs and practically on the floor!!! Rooms very stark, bathroom was ok if you didn't look at the a/c vent. I really didn't want to stay there but didn't want to move at 10:00 pm either. I already paid, and oh yeah, they \"authorize\" your credit card for an extra $50 that they refund to your account when you leave.....there isn't $50 worth of anything I would want in that hotel. When I checked out and told them what I thought, they said it would start being refurbished at the end of the year.

There is only a small typical hotel room table and 3 chairs, so for eating the meals you have cooked all together can cause a certain logistic problem. The kitchenet is not fully equiped. The kitchen tools are very basic, very small stove, no oven. For pots and pan, ask at the desk because they do not let them in the suite because people steal them.

The shower offered plenty of hot water and the free breakfast bar was delicious. Scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, fresh fruit and Starbuck's coffee.

Conveniently situated about 5 minutes from the Airport Terminal and also from the Car Hire Centre. The Hotel runs a shuttle every 15 minutes to the Airport which seems to work well. Situated close to the junctions of the I.17 to Flagstaff and the I.10 to Tucson in the south. The Motel is situated on two levels, but with no lift which could be a problem to some with luggage. The rooms are clean and ours contained two reasonably comfortable twin beds, room safe, TV and a small balcony. There was some noise overnight from the Airport and Interstates - this was not so bad as to create a problem, but clearly the sound insulation is not as good as it might be. The Motel has a small pool and whirlpool and provides some light refreshment in the morning, but not a breakfast - there is an adjoining Roadhouse Restaurant providing meals throughout the day which seemed quite good. The one disappointment which I had was that, after a long drive from Sedona, they would not let me check in at 2.30pm insisting that it had to be the stipulated 4pm. Can't really complain at that, but most hotels do allow early check in. Apart from that Reception Staff were friendly and helpful.

The room's value is OK, but not the best. The clock in the room and the wake up feature on the phone were both not functioning. There is no elevator to the second floor so one must drag one's bags up the stairs with no help. The very limited continental breakfast is only served until 0800 hours.

This is my third time staying at this property with a group tour! Property is always very clean and well kept. Rooms are comfortable..and again, very clean. In addition, price is right especially when compared to other Branson properties! If you want to stay on the strip, this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice, clean, comfortable, well-priced place to spend your nights...I suggest you look into Branson Towers! I enjoyed working with the group tours staff as they were always very cheerful and helpful! As an added bonus, they have a nice feature serving cobbler and ice cream beginning at 10:00 p.m. When you come back from a show it is a nice option to be able to have a little before bed snack!! Plus the piano player they have there makes for a very nice atmosphere and a nice way to end the day!!", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings":3.0, "HotelID":"Hotel_03", "Author": "Author17", "ReviewID": "UR0048", "Content": "This hotel was alright I guess if your on a budget. The beds were really comfortable and the air conditioning worked really well so for $60 you can't expect much more. The smell of the room was horrible though! Smelled like someone chain smoked in it for years. Just looking for a little weekend getaway so we weren't expecting anything spectacular. Probably wouldn't stay here again due to the smell.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings":1.0, "HotelID":"Hotel_04", "Author": "Author19", "ReviewID": "UR0049", "Content": "This was our stay at Branson Towers. We have stayed at several other nice motels in Branson and was surpised the Branson Towers had reasonable rates. We had a handicapped room on first flower, near the vending machines, parking lot and restaurant. The breakfast was deliciious in a beautiful large dining room setting. Another plus was the coffee machine near the parking lot door. We would get a cup on the way to our room....anytime of day. The room was large and very clean. As we walked into the hotel you could smell a clean smell.
